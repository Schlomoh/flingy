              location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much
              information we collect depends on the type and settings of the

              and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us

              allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to
              the information or by disabling your Location setting on your

              to use certain aspects of the Services.

              that we can match the information you provide with the information
              we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
              communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously
